# Dialogue System


# Dialogue Systems importance

A few years before video games emerged, exactly in 1966 a professor of computer science at MIT, Joseph Weizenbaum, developed a program that allowed emulating a conversation with a therapist. That program would be called ELIZA and would be the first attempt to try to emulate a conversation between humans and machines.

It did not take too long for videogames to start using dialogues in some way to use them as support to tell stories. Games like Adventure by William Crowther in 1972 credited as the first RPG used a text interface to transmit to the player what was happening around him.

A few years later, Monkey Island in 1990 will revolutionize the market with its new system of choice of dialogue that allowed the player to give the feeling of freedom to choose what he wanted to say to other NPCs. Games like the Fallout saga depend tremendously on the dialogue, on how the player interacts with the NPCs and influences them to forge their story within the game.

But the dialogues not only depend in how good the lines between interactions are, the different kinds of systems that each videogame uses to make the interaction between the player and the game are important too.

# Different Dialog Systems in videogames

## Non-branching Dialog

This type of dialogue is the typical interaction between the player and an NPC, where the player can not choose what to say, and is simply limited to normally pressing a button for the dialogue to continue, in this case the game itself will be chosen by the player what his character will say. The conversation may change if the player talks to the NPC again but has no control over what his character says.

## Branching Dialog

In this type of dialog the player has more control about what he/she wants to say.
